      <h1>What is Actually Football?</h1>
      <p>
        Football (or soccer) is a team sport in which two sides of eleven
        players each try to score by kicking a spherical ball into the opposing
        goal; apart from the goalkeeper—who may use their hands within a marked
        area—players must maneuver the ball using feet, head, or torso, and the
        game is governed internationally by FIFA. Despite regional naming
        differences (“football” in most countries, “soccer” in North America),
        the rules and objective remain the same worldwide.
