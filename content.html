          Pizza is a beloved, versatile dish originating from Naples, Italy,
          known for its delicious combination of flavors and customizable
          toppings. Typically, pizza consists of a flat, crusty base of

          cheese, and a variety of other ingredients like vegetables, meats, and
          herbs.</i
