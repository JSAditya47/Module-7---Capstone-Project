          A burger is a patty of ground meat grilled and placed between two
          halves of a bun. Slices of raw onion, lettuce, bacon, mayonnaise, and
          other ingredients add flavor. Burgers are considered an American food
          but are popular around the world.</i

          Biryani is a fragrant, layered rice dish popular in South Asia,
          particularly in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It's made with rice
          (often basmati), meat (like chicken, lamb, or goat), and a blend of
          aromatic spices. Vegetables can also be used in vegetarian versions.
          The dish is cooked with a slow, gentle technique, often involving
          steaming or "dum" cooking, which helps to develop the flavors.
